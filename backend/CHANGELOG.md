# Changelog

All notable changes to the Breakdown backend will be documented in this
file. The shipped artifact is the `api` Docker image (ADR-020 D6), tagged
by Git tag `api-vX.Y.Z` where `X.Y.Z` is the `api` crate version at the
release commit; the entry version below is therefore the **api image
release**. Companion crates (`core`, `infra`) carry their own independent
versions per ADR-020 D1; the versions at this release are noted in the
entry.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [api-v0.14.0] – Released 2026-10-04

- Shipped artifact: `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:api-v0.14.0` (immutable,
  SHA-pinned digest) plus the moving tags `api-v0.14` and `api-v0`.
- Companion crate versions at this release: `core 0.16.0`,
  `infra 0.20.0`, `api 0.14.0`.
- Covers everything since the last tagged image release `api-v0.7.1`.

### Added

- **Scene costume casting (issue #546):** ordered costume beats per
  `(scene, character)` pair — scene-side costume casting with sequence
  ordering, plus the AI-import persistence of the extracted scene
  relation via `AssignCharacter` + `AddCostumeBeat` mapping-row phases.
- **Costume details (issues #544, #545):** create, edit, and delete
  costume details.
- **One costume = one category:** `category_id` moves onto the costume,
  replacing the many-to-many association; costume category picker
  support in the API surface.
- **Season repertoire (issue #453):** unassigned costumes become visible
  in their season's costume stream.
- **AI import:** provider replacement (issue #528); combined input and
  config editing improvements; dedicated `ai-import.disabled` problem
  code for the feature flag; scoped forbidden wire codes.
- **EU AI Act compliance:** Art. 50 AI provenance on scenes and Art. 4/50
  transparency surfaces (point-of-interaction disclosure).
- **Reliability / cross-aggregate invariants (issues #404, #37):**
  uniqueness enforced at the API edge with projector savepoint-skip for
  the authoritative constraints; generic projection dead-letter
  (durable `projection_dead_letter` row, checkpoint advance, health
  signal) so a permanent constraint violation never kills the projector;
  authenticated projector-health ops endpoint.
- **Dev runtime:** Vault overlay + credential-role bootstrap; one-liner
  to enable AI import for the host-run dev API; deterministic
  block-conflict fault injection for the wizard Gherkin suites;
  dev-flavor `DEFAULT_SERIES_ID` bootstrap guard + fault injection.
- **ADR-031:** extraction-rejection regression tests + wizard fail-fast.
- **Tier-4:** DB-backed regression test for the #404 numbering-projector
  path; CommandService-driven CreateScene round-trip restored.

### Fixed

- **Photos:** `photo_thumbnail_saga` no longer crash-loops on aggregate
  misses; the upload 201 response is built from command output instead
  of a projection read; photo commands allowed on repertoire-scoped
  costumes; photo commands gated on character assignment.
- **Settings / credentials:** the binding owner is verified on credential
  rotate/revoke; a `vault_key_id` the caller does not own is rejected.
- **Queries:** scene read-model fan-out deduplicated over joined pivots.
- **Concurrency:** stale-version writes emit `409
  concurrency.version-mismatch` instead of a generic 422
  aggregate-version error across remaining aggregates.
- **Error surface:** AI-import and settings-credential errors key on
  scoped wire codes the backend actually emits; OpenAPI `value_type`
  overrides carry `Option` nullability.

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** utoipa 5 → 6 and utoipa-swagger-ui 9 → 10 in
  lockstep; OpenTelemetry crate family 0.33 in lockstep; opendal 0.59;
  redis 1.7; assorted cargo minor/patch bumps via Dependabot groups.
